## 0.8.2

- Copies any data-* HTML5 attributes from the target div to the hidden input that gets rendered (useful for validation and such)

## 0.8.3

- Removes the 'name' attribute from the target div, which was causing a weird issue with jquery/.Net MVC unobtrusive validation

## 0.9.0

- Collapsable area is now detached so that it can still be visible if the target div is inside a container that's overflow:hidden

## 0.9.1

- Fixed a positioning issue when an ancestor has margin/padding/offset
